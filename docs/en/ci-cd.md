# CI/CD and Jenkins workflow reference

The following Windows batch fragments show the guarded workflow stages.

For pull requests these candidate, C++, and publication stages are internal to
`.github/workflows/pr-self-runner.yml`; `create-pr` submits source changes only. After full validation, the workflow
publishes the exact guarded snapshot/gamedata bytes, pushes a bot commit to the PR head, and explicitly dispatches an
Ubuntu-only provenance/digest recheck for that new head. If the bot push emits a `pull_request.synchronize` event, PR
preflight verifies the publication trailers and routes that event to the same lightweight recheck instead of rebuilding.

## Download binaries

```batch
@echo Download latest game binaries

uv run download_depot.py -tag %CS2_GAMEVER%
uv run copy_depot_bin.py -gamever %CS2_GAMEVER% -platform %CS2_PLATFORM%
```

## Analyze binaries

GitHub Actions does not let PR or release analysis create an IDB inline. Both workflows first call the reusable
`.github/workflows/warmup-idb.yml` producer. It prepares the configured binaries in an isolated workspace, derives a
cache identity from the binary inventory and IDA version, and publishes an immutable generation below
`PERSISTED_WORKSPACE/idb-cache/<GAMEVER>/generations/` only after every `.i64` and the complete payload inventory pass
validation.

The producer returns the exact generation and cache key to its caller. PR and release jobs verify that their local
IDA kernel version matches the producer, restore that generation
instead of copying `.i64` files from `PERSISTED_WORKSPACE/bin/<GAMEVER>`, then run `ida_analyze_bin.py` with
`-require_warm_idb`. A missing, damaged, mismatched, or failed warm cache stops analysis; CI never falls back to inline
IDA auto-analysis. This also lets a PR consume the cache before the generated-output PR is merged.

The producer prunes interrupted `.incoming-*` directories after 24 hours and retains at least the three newest cache
generations plus the READY generation; older generations are eligible for removal after seven days. Release staging
excludes all IDA database artifacts, so transactional promotion no longer creates a second accepted copy below
`PERSISTED_WORKSPACE/bin/<GAMEVER>`.

Pruning is intentionally limited to the GAMEVER being produced. Cache roots for retired GAMEVERs are not removed
automatically; runner operators must periodically delete unused `idb-cache/<GAMEVER>` roots after confirming that no
active PR or release run still references their explicit generations.

```batch
@echo Analyze game binaries

uv run ida_analyze_bin.py -gamever %CS2_GAMEVER% -agent=claude.cmd -platform %CS2_PLATFORM% -debug
```

## Build the immutable symbol candidate

```batch
@echo Build the immutable candidate immediately after analysis

set "CANDIDATE_ID=%RANDOM%"
set "CANDIDATE_ROOT=%TEMP%\cs2vibe-%CS2_GAMEVER%-%CANDIDATE_ID%"
set "CANDIDATE_SNAPSHOT=%CANDIDATE_ROOT%\%CS2_GAMEVER%.yaml"
set "CANDIDATE_SESSION=%CANDIDATE_ROOT%\%CS2_GAMEVER%.session.json"
set "GAMEDATA_ROOT=%CANDIDATE_ROOT%\gamedata-candidate"
set "GAMEDATA_SESSION=%CANDIDATE_ROOT%\%CS2_GAMEVER%.gamedata.session.json"
if not exist "%CANDIDATE_ROOT%" mkdir "%CANDIDATE_ROOT%"
uv run gamesymbol_candidate.py build -gamever %CS2_GAMEVER% -bindir bin -configyaml configs/%CS2_GAMEVER%.yaml -output "%CANDIDATE_SNAPSHOT%" -session "%CANDIDATE_SESSION%"
```

## Build and guard the gamedata candidate

```batch
@echo Build gamedata from the immutable symbol candidate

uv run gamedata_candidate.py build -gamever %CS2_GAMEVER% -build-id %CANDIDATE_ID% -snapshot "%CANDIDATE_SNAPSHOT%" -configyaml configs/%CS2_GAMEVER%.yaml -candidate-root "%GAMEDATA_ROOT%" -session "%GAMEDATA_SESSION%"
uv run gamedata_candidate.py guard -session "%GAMEDATA_SESSION%"
uv run gamesymbol_candidate.py mark -candidate "%CANDIDATE_SNAPSHOT%" -session "%CANDIDATE_SESSION%" -step gamedata
```

## Validate C++ headers and publish the candidates

```batch
@echo Validate and publish the guarded candidates

uv run run_cpp_tests.py -gamever %CS2_GAMEVER% -configyaml configs/%CS2_GAMEVER%.yaml -snapshot "%CANDIDATE_SNAPSHOT%" -debug
uv run gamesymbol_candidate.py mark -candidate "%CANDIDATE_SNAPSHOT%" -session "%CANDIDATE_SESSION%" -step cpp_tests
uv run gamesymbol_candidate.py publish -candidate "%CANDIDATE_SNAPSHOT%" -session "%CANDIDATE_SESSION%" -snapshot gamesymbols/%CS2_GAMEVER%.yaml
uv run gamedata_candidate.py publish -session "%GAMEDATA_SESSION%" -outputdir gamedata/%CS2_GAMEVER%
```
