# Completion checklist

- If changing scripts/config, ensure CLI usage in README and docstrings stays accurate.
- Before completion, run `uv run python format_repo_files.py --check` to verify formatting for tracked Python/YAML files. Use `uv run python format_repo_files.py` to apply formatting when needed.
- Formatting uses Ruff for `*.py` and yamlfix for tracked `*.yaml`; generated YAML under `ida_preprocessor_scripts/references/` is intentionally skipped.
- If outputs are expected, verify YAML in bin/<gamever>/... and gamedata outputs in dist/...
