# CS2 VibeSignatures

[中文文档](README_CN.md) | [GUI](https://mrc4tt.github.io/CS2_VibeSignatures/)

CS2 VibeSignatures generates CS2 signatures and offsets, updates HL2SDK_CS2 C++ headers through Agent skills and MCP calls, and produces versioned downstream gamedata.

The project is designed to update signatures, offsets, and C++ headers without manual intervention. It currently automates the signatures and offsets consumed by CounterStrikeSharp, CS2Fixes, and other supported projects.

## Quick start

Install the [requirements](docs/en/requirements.md), then prepare and analyze one game version:

```bash
uv sync
uv run download_depot.py -tag 14156
uv run copy_depot_bin.py -gamever 14156 -platform all-platform
uv run ida_analyze_bin.py -gamever 14156 -oldgamever 14155
```

These commands populate the binary workspace under `bin/<GAMEVER>/` and run the configured deterministic, LLM-assisted, and Agent-assisted analysis. Canonical per-symbol results belong in `bin_artifacts/<GAMEVER>/` and must be committed with the source/config changes that produce them.

The only Git-tracked symbol truth is `bin_artifacts/<GAMEVER>/<module>/*.yaml`. Source-owned
`binary_locks/<GAMEVER>.json` binds the exact configured binary bytes to the corresponding immutable depot manifests;
`bin/` remains a disposable binary/IDA workspace. Snapshots, metadata, gamedata, archives, and manifests are
Release-derived assets and are not tracked on `main`.

## Supported gamedata

Versioned gamedata is generated for CounterStrikeSharp, CS2Fixes, CS2FOW, swiftlys2, plugify, cs2kz-metamod, modsharp, and CS2Surf/Timer. See [supported gamedata paths and exceptions](docs/en/snapshot-and-gamedata.md#supported-gamedata).
