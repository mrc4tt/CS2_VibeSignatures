# CS2 VibeSignatures

[中文文档](README_CN.md) | [GUI](https://hlnd2t.github.io/CS2_VibeSignatures/)

CS2 VibeSignatures generates CS2 signatures and offsets, updates HL2SDK_CS2 C++ headers through Agent skills and MCP calls, and produces versioned downstream gamedata.

The project is designed to update signatures, offsets, and C++ headers without manual intervention. It currently automates the signatures and offsets consumed by CounterStrikeSharp, CS2Fixes, and other supported projects.

## Quick start

Install the [requirements](docs/en/requirements.md), then prepare and analyze one game version:

```bash
uv sync
uv run download_depot.py -tag 14156
uv run copy_depot_bin.py -gamever 14156 -platform all-platform
uv run ida_analyze_bin.py -gamever 14156 -oldgamever 14155
```

These commands populate `bin/<GAMEVER>/` and run the configured deterministic, LLM-assisted, and Agent-assisted analysis. Continue with the immutable candidate, gamedata, and C++ validation flow before publishing tracked outputs.

## Workflow

1. [Download the CS2 depot and copy target binaries](docs/en/analysis.md#download-the-cs2-depot).
2. [Analyze symbols declared by `configs/<GAMEVER>.yaml`](docs/en/analysis.md#analyze-configured-symbols).
3. [Build one immutable symbol and gamedata candidate](docs/en/snapshot-and-gamedata.md#immutable-candidate-transaction).
4. [Run C++ layout validation against that candidate](docs/en/snapshot-and-gamedata.md#run-c-layout-validation).
5. [Publish the validated snapshot and versioned gamedata](docs/en/snapshot-and-gamedata.md#immutable-candidate-transaction).

Canonical tracked outputs are `gamesymbols/<GAMEVER>.yaml` and `gamedata/<GAMEVER>/`. Per-symbol analysis YAML remains private mutable state under `bin/<GAMEVER>/`.

## Supported gamedata

Versioned gamedata is generated for CounterStrikeSharp, CS2Fixes, swiftlys2, plugify, cs2kz-metamod, modsharp, and CS2Surf/Timer. See [supported gamedata paths and exceptions](docs/en/snapshot-and-gamedata.md#supported-gamedata).
