  Create an Agent SKILL.md fallback for an existing find-XXXX finder that relies on a fragile discovery

  does not cover. The generated fallback coexists with the preprocessor and runs only when it returns failure,
  recovering every target robustly by decompiling the predecessor and following the inline/de-inline boundary
  with semantic anchors. Use when a finder broke on a game update, or you want to durably backstop one before it
  does. The recipe generalizes to any finder foundation.

# Create an Agent SKILL.md Fallback for a Finder

Given a target `find-XXXX` finder whose preprocessor uses a fragile foundation (most often **LLM_DECOMPILE**),
author `.claude/skills/find-XXXX/SKILL.md` — the **Agent fallback** that `ida_analyze_bin.py` runs only when the
preprocessor returns failure. The preprocessor stays as-is; this skill adds a durable backstop beside it.

This is the robustness-oriented sibling of `/convert-finder-skill-to-preprocessor-scripts` (that skill turns a
SKILL.md *into* a preprocessor; this one gives a preprocessor a SKILL.md *fallback*).

## When to Use

- A `find-XXXX` finder failed on a new game version because a member/vfunc/function was **inlined or
  de-inlined** relative to what its LLM_DECOMPILE reference expects (classic symptom: one target in a
  multi-target `-decompiles` skill can no longer be found, aborting the module).
- You want to **pre-emptively** backstop an LLM_DECOMPILE-based finder (patterns C/D/E) whose correctness hinges
  on a predecessor keeping a fixed decompiled shape.
- The recipe also applies to xref-string / found_call / index-based finders — the foundation differs, but the
  same "self-contained, skip-existing, anchor semantically, follow the callee" method holds.

Do **not** use this to replace a working preprocessor. The fallback is a safety net; the preprocessor remains
the fast path.

## The one constraint that drives the whole design

When the preprocessor fails, `agent_runner.run_skill` launches the agent with a prompt of **only
`/{skill_name}`** (see `_build_claude_command`, profile `sig-finder`). The skill's `expected_yaml_paths` is used
**only** for post-run missing-file verification (`_missing_expected_outputs` / `_result_failure_reason`) — it is
**never** injected into the prompt, and the missing list is not fed back to the agent on retry.

Consequence: the fallback SKILL.md you generate MUST be **fully self-contained**. It must enumerate every
output, gate each by platform, and tell the agent to **skip outputs whose YAML already exists** (the
preprocessor may have written most of them before failing; earlier fallback skills may have written others).

## Inputs to gather (read these before writing anything)

For target finder `find-XXXX` in module `<module>` (`server`, `engine`, `networksystem`, …):

1. **Preprocessor** `ida_preprocessor_scripts/find-XXXX.py` — the source of truth for *what* to find:
   - `TARGET_FUNCTION_NAMES`, `TARGET_STRUCT_MEMBER_NAMES`, `TARGET_GLOBALVAR_NAMES` and any
     `*_WINDOWS` / `*_LINUX` variants → the output symbols and their **platform gating**.
   - `LLM_DECOMPILE` (and `_WINDOWS`/`_LINUX`) → the **predecessor** reference each target is mined from
     (`references/<module>/<predecessor>.{platform}.yaml`).
   - `FUNC_VTABLE_RELATIONS` → which targets are vtable-related (`vtable_name`).
   - `GENERATE_YAML_DESIRED_FIELDS` → the **exact fields and kind** for each target (this tells you whether a
     target is a struct member, an indirect-vcall vfunc, a real vfunc, a regular func, or a global var — see the
     kind table below).
   - any `FUNC_XREFS` (string/gv anchors) — extra fingerprints you can reuse.
2. **`config.yaml` skill entry** — `expected_output` / `expected_output_windows` / `expected_output_linux`
   (authoritative output list per platform), `expected_input` (the predecessor YAML), `platform`,
   `prerequisite`.
3. **Reference YAMLs** `ida_preprocessor_scripts/references/<module>/<predecessor>.{platform}.yaml` — the
   `disasm_code` + `procedure` carry the annotations `; 0xNN = Class::member` and
   `; 0xNN = Class::vfunc` / `// NNNN = 0xNN = …` at each access/call site. **These annotations are the semantic
   fingerprints** you translate into the fallback's anchors.
4. **Ground-truth output YAMLs** `bin/<gamever>/<module>/<target>.{platform}.yaml` — the **authoritative**
   offsets, vfunc indices, and signature styles the finder currently produces. Mine these for the reference
   values in the inventory table. `<gamever>` comes from `.env` (`CS2VIBE_GAMEVER`); `bin/` is gitignored, so
   read whatever versions exist. Document these as *reference values that change per update and per platform* —
   never as fixed answers.

Cross-check every value across the reference annotation AND the ground-truth YAML; where they disagree, trust
the ground-truth YAML and note the discrepancy (references occasionally mis-annotate — see the decoy caution).

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Build the output inventory

From the preprocessor `.py` + config entry, list every output as `(symbol, kind, platform, predecessor,
desired-fields)`. Determine `kind` from `GENERATE_YAML_DESIRED_FIELDS` using this table:

| Kind | Tell-tale desired fields | Sig-gen skill | Writer skill |
|------|--------------------------|---------------|--------------|
| struct member | `struct_name, member_name, offset, offset_sig[, size, offset_sig_disp]` | `/generate-signature-for-structoffset` | `/write-structoffset-as-yaml` |
| indirect vcall (`call [reg+disp]`, no body) | `vfunc_sig, vfunc_offset, vfunc_index, vtable_name` and **no** `func_va`/`func_sig` | `/generate-signature-for-vfuncoffset` | `/write-vfunc-as-yaml` (`func_addr=None`, `func_sig=None`) |
| real vtable vfunc (has a body) | `func_va/func_sig` **and** `vtable_name/vfunc_offset/vfunc_index` | `/generate-signature-for-function` | `/write-vfunc-as-yaml` (+ vtable fields) |
| regular function | `func_name, func_sig, func_va, func_rva, func_size` (no vtable fields) | `/generate-signature-for-function` | `/write-func-as-yaml` |
| global variable | `gv_name, gv_va, gv_sig, gv_inst_*` | `/generate-signature-for-globalvar` | `/write-globalvar-as-yaml` |

The indirect-vcall kind is easy to miss: its YAML has **no `func_va`** and its `vfunc_sig` is the signature of
the *call instruction itself* (e.g. `FF 90 A0 00 00 00` = `call qword ptr [rax+0A0h]`), not of any target
function body. Treat it as such — do not try to resolve a concrete implementation address.

### Step 2 — Confirm platform gating and the predecessor

From the config entry, record which outputs are cross-platform vs `expected_output_windows` /
`expected_output_linux`, and the predecessor(s) from `expected_input`. A symbol that is de-inlined into a
separate function on one platform but inlined on the other is common (that asymmetry is often *why* the finder
is fragile).

### Step 3 — Extract per-target fingerprints

For each target, read its access/call site in the reference `disasm_code` + `procedure` and write down:
- the **semantic anchor**: the nearest stable landmark — a string literal, a magic constant, a named
  global/interface call, a distinctive helper — that identifies the site independent of address;
- the **`this`-relative offset** (members) or **call displacement** (indirect vcalls) or **vtable index**;
- the **reference value** from the ground-truth `bin/` YAML (both platforms where they differ).

### Step 4 — Write the fallback SKILL.md

Create `.claude/skills/find-XXXX/SKILL.md` from the template below. Fill every placeholder; keep only the
target kinds that actually occur. The output filename MUST equal the finder's skill name so
`agent_runner.run_skill` finds it.

### Step 5 — Validate

- `uv run python format_repo_files.py --check` (markdown is not reformatted, but this confirms nothing else
  broke).
- `uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests -b` (guard; a pure-doc addition should not affect tests).
- Re-read the generated SKILL.md against the inventory: is every output listed, platform-gated, and mapped to a
  sig-gen + writer skill with correct params?

Be honest about the validation boundary: when the preprocessor currently **succeeds** (e.g. on the latest
build) the fallback does not trigger in a normal `ida_analyze_bin.py` run, and exercising it directly needs the
**ida-pro-mcp GUI** path with the binary open (not idalib) plus a forced preprocessor failure. Correctness
therefore rests on the ground-truth cross-check, not an end-to-end run. Say so in your report.

### Step 6 — Commit

Stage the new SKILL.md **explicitly** (never `git add -A`). If on `main`, branch to `dev` first. Commit with a
message naming the finder. Then record a one-line memory pointer per the repo workflow.

# Find XXXX (final-guarantee fallback)

Recover every symbol the find-XXXX preprocessor produces, in CS2 `<binary.dll>` / `<libbinary.so>`, using IDA
Pro MCP tools. This is the Agent fallback: it runs only when the preprocessor returned failure — which almost
always means a target's access pattern **moved** across the inline/de-inline boundary.

## Background — <PREDECESSOR> and what it wires up

<2–5 sentences: what the predecessor does and which targets it touches, in source terms. Note that all member
accesses are relative to `this` (arg1: rcx/rsi on Windows, rdi/rbx on Linux) — the key to robustness.>

## Robustness principle — follow the de-inline boundary

For every target: (1) look for its access pattern inside `<PREDECESSOR>`; (2) if absent, it was de-inlined —
enumerate the functions `<PREDECESSOR>` calls, decompile the plausible ones, and search there (the helper
receives `this` as its first argument, so the same `this + offset` reappears; recurse a level or two);
(3) conversely a target the reference expected in a separate function may have been inlined back into
`<PREDECESSOR>`. Anchor each target by its semantic fingerprint (string / constant / neighboring call), never by
a fixed address or containing function.

## Output inventory

`struct_name` is `<STRUCT>` where applicable. Offsets/indices are **reference values from build <gamever> —
verify against the binary, do not assume**.

| # | Output symbol | Kind | Windows | Linux | Writer skill |
|---|---------------|------|---------|-------|--------------|
| 1 | `<symbol>` | <kind> | `<value or "inlined — skip">` | `<value or "inlined — skip">` | `/write-...-as-yaml` |
| … | | | | | |

Platform gating: <list cross-platform vs windows-only / linux-only outputs>.

## Step 0. Skip targets already produced

For each output, if `<name>.<platform>.yaml` already exists beside the binary and parses to a non-empty mapping,
skip it — the preprocessor or an earlier fallback wrote it. List the directory with:

```
mcp__ida-pro-mcp__py_eval code="import idaapi, os; d=os.path.dirname(idaapi.get_input_file_path()); print('\n'.join(sorted(f for f in os.listdir(d) if f.endswith('.yaml'))))"
```

`/get-func-from-yaml` also reports existence for functions/vfuncs.

## Step 1. Load and decompile the predecessor

**ALWAYS** Use SKILL `/get-func-from-yaml` with `func_name=<PREDECESSOR>` to get its `func_va`. If it errors,
**STOP** and report to user. Then:

```
mcp__ida-pro-mcp__decompile addr="<PREDECESSOR.func_va>"
```

Note the `this` register and keep the list of called functions for the de-inline search.

## Step 2…N. Resolve each target

<One subsection per target (or per cluster sharing a call site). For each: the semantic anchor, the
this-relative offset / call displacement / vtable index, the reference value, and how to handle de-inline. Note
any decoys.>

## Signatures and YAML output

<Per kind, the sig-gen skill + writer skill + exact params — copy from the kind table. E.g. struct members →
/generate-signature-for-structoffset → /write-structoffset-as-yaml with struct_name/member_name/offset/size=None/
offset_sig/offset_sig_disp; indirect vcalls → /generate-signature-for-vfuncoffset → /write-vfunc-as-yaml with
func_addr=None, func_sig=None, vfunc_sig, vtable_name, vfunc_offset, vfunc_index=offset/8.>

## Failure handling

- Predecessor YAML missing → **STOP** and report.
- A required target unresolved even after following callees → resolve the rest, then **STOP** and report exactly
  which output(s) failed so the user can extend the references.
- Never emit a platform-gated symbol on the wrong platform.

## Output YAML filenames

Written beside the binary, one per symbol: `<symbol>.windows.yaml` / `<symbol>.linux.yaml`.

## Robustness principles (the heart of a good fallback)

1. **Anchor semantically, not positionally.** A fixed address or "it's in function F" breaks on the next update.
   A string literal, a magic constant (e.g. an FNV seed `0x811C9DC5`), a named interface call, or a distinctive
   helper survives.
2. **`this + offset` is stable across the inline boundary.** Struct offsets are relative to the class pointer
   (arg1). Whether the access is inlined in the predecessor or de-inlined into a helper that receives `this`,
   the same `this + offset` appears — so members are recoverable either way.
3. **Follow the callee (the core move).** If a target isn't in the predecessor, enumerate the predecessor's
   calls, decompile them, and recurse. This is what makes the fallback a *guarantee* rather than a re-run of the
   fragile reference match. Cover the inline-back case too.
4. **Know the indirect-vcall shape.** For `call qword ptr [reg + disp]` on an interface pointer, the output is
   `vtable_name` + `vfunc_offset = disp` + `vfunc_index = disp/8` + a `vfunc_sig` pinning the call instruction;
   there is **no `func_va`**. Resolve the interface from the receiver global's type.
5. **Watch for decoys.** References sometimes annotate two nearby offsets with the same member name. Trust the
   ground-truth `bin/` YAML. (Real example: `CEntitySystem::m_eNetworkSerializationMode` is the DWORD at
   `0xBBC`, set from the mode param and re-read at the SetNetworkSerializationContextData call — **not** the byte
   flag at `0xBDA`, even though the reference labels both.)
6. **The offset is the must-have; the signature is best-effort.** For struct members, `offset` is the required
   output; `offset_sig` is for relocation and may legitimately be omitted (write offset only) when a unique
   signature can't be found — especially for members whose access spans a function boundary.

## Worked example — `find-CEntitySystem_Init-decompiles`

The canonical output of this workflow lives at
`.claude/skills/find-CEntitySystem_Init-decompiles/SKILL.md` (commit `a31fdf4`). Study it as the reference.

- **Fragile foundation:** `ida_preprocessor_scripts/find-CEntitySystem_Init-decompiles.py` mines 11 targets by
  LLM_DECOMPILE off one predecessor, `CEntitySystem_Init`
  (reference `references/server/CEntitySystem_Init.{platform}.yaml`).
- **What broke:** on Windows 14168, `CEntitySystem_InitEntityMaterialAttributes` was de-inlined out of
  `CEntitySystem_Init`, so the `m_EntityMaterialAttributes` access left the predecessor and the LLM match
  failed, aborting the module.
- **What the fallback covers:** all 11 targets — 7 cross-platform struct members, 2 indirect-vcall vtable
  offsets (`INetworkMessages_SetNetworkSerializationContextData` @0xA0/idx20,
  `IFlattenedSerializers_CreateFieldChangedEventQueue` @0x118/idx35), Linux-only
  `CEntitySystem_ProcessEntityRegistration`, and Windows-only `m_EntityMaterialAttributes` (@0x2070) — each
  anchored by a fingerprint (the `"string_t_table"` call, the `CUtlScratchMemoryPool::Init(_, 0x400, …)` call,
  the FNV material-hash loop, …) and recoverable whether inlined or de-inlined.
- It demonstrates every section of the template: the inventory table, Step-0 skip, follow-the-callee, the
  indirect-vcall shape, the `0xBBC`-vs-`0xBDA` decoy note, and the offset-is-must-have caveat for the
  field-change trio.
