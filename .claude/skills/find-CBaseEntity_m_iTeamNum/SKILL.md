  Locate CBaseEntity::m_iTeamNum in CS2 server.dll / libserver.so via IDA Pro MCP and emit a fresh, minimal-unique
  signature or offset for the local gamedata entry "CBaseEntity::m_iTeamNum" (symbol CBaseEntity_m_iTeamNum). This is a STRUCT MEMBER OFFSET (schema netvar), not a function. Resolve the
CBaseEntity class layout via the schema/network system; the member must satisfy
natural alignment. Cross-check with functions that dereference the member.

# Find CBaseEntity_m_iTeamNum

Target: `CBaseEntity::m_iTeamNum` (structmember) in the CS2 server module.

## Method

This is a STRUCT MEMBER OFFSET (schema netvar), not a function. Resolve the
CBaseEntity class layout via the schema/network system; the member must satisfy
natural alignment. Cross-check with functions that dereference the member.

## Mandatory self-check before emitting

The pipeline re-reads the bytes at your `func_va` and deterministically regenerates `func_sig` from
them - if your `func_sig` does not match those bytes EXACTLY (with `??` matching anything), the run
aborts. Therefore:

1. After picking the function, read the actual bytes at `func_va` via the IDA MCP.
2. Derive `func_sig` FROM those bytes: keep stable opcode bytes literally, wildcard relocated or
   variable operands as `??`.
3. `func_sig` MUST start at `func_va` (the true function head).
4. Only then write the YAML. A mismatch is always a bug in YOUR output, never in the pipeline.

## Output schema (STRICT)

Write the YAML file `<symbol>.{platform}.yaml` with EXACTLY these fields:
```yaml
struct_name: <owning class name>
member_name: <member name>
offset: "<hex byte offset as string>"
size: <member size in bytes, decimal>
offset_sig: "<short byte pattern of an instruction touching the offset>"
```
NEVER include func_* or vfunc_* fields.

## Verification

1. Decompile the candidate and confirm the behavior matches the purpose above (not a caller or callee).
2. Confirm uniqueness: the generated pattern must match exactly one location in the loaded binary.
3. If a candidate cannot be confirmed, report the shortlist instead of guessing - a skipped symbol is
   safer than a wrong signature.
