# gv_sig

## Overview
`gv_sig` is the relocation signature for global-variable discovery, anchored at a GV-access instruction. It is also the baseline cross-boundary semantics that `func_sig` / `vfunc_sig` / `offset_sig` now align with.

## Field Context
- Related YAML fields: `gv_name`, `gv_va`, `gv_rva`, `gv_sig`, `gv_sig_va`, `gv_inst_offset`, `gv_inst_length`, `gv_inst_disp`.
- Optional generation/persistence field: `gv_sig_allow_across_function_boundary`.

## Generation Principle
- Canonical auto-generation is implemented by `preprocess_gen_gv_sig_via_mcp` in `ida_analyze_util.py`.
- Input anchor is known `gv_va`, optionally constrained by `gv_access_inst_va` / `gv_access_func_va`.
- Candidate GV-access instructions are discovered in priority order:
  1. explicit `gv_access_inst_va`
  2. instruction scan in `gv_access_func_va`
  3. fallback `DataRefsTo(gv_va)` code refs
- For each candidate instruction, RIP-relative displacement (`disp_i32`) is validated to resolve to `gv_va`.
- Signature is collected forward on instruction boundaries.
- Volatile bytes are wildcarded (`??`), including the GV displacement bytes themselves.
- Default behavior is fail-closed at the owning function boundary.
- Optional directive `gv_sig_allow_across_function_boundary: true` enables collection past `f.end_ea` when the in-function bytes are insufficient.
- Cross-boundary collection is conservative: it stays in the same executable segment, only consumes explicit padding bytes (`0xCC` / `0x90`) after the source function end, allows a zero-padding handoff directly to the next IDA code head, and resumes decoding only at an IDA-marked code head in the next function. Encountering non-padding data, non-code heads, decode failure, or a segment boundary stops the candidate.
- Directive parsing is shared with the newer signature types via `_normalize_generate_yaml_desired_fields`; bare directives, duplicate directives, and non-`true` values are rejected.
- Candidate acceptance requires:
  - exactly one `find_bytes(limit=2)` match
  - matched address equals the candidate GV-access instruction address
- The shortest accepted candidate becomes `gv_sig`.
- Generator outputs `gv_sig_va`, `gv_inst_offset` (currently `0`), `gv_inst_length`, `gv_inst_disp`, and `gv_va/gv_rva`.

## Usage Method
- In `preprocess_gv_sig_via_mcp`, old `gv_sig` + `gv_inst_*` metadata are reused to relocate the GV address in a new binary.
- Flow:
  1. Load `gv_sig`, `gv_inst_offset`, `gv_inst_length`, `gv_inst_disp`.
  2. Unique-match `gv_sig` -> `gv_sig_va`.
  3. Compute instruction address: `inst_addr = gv_sig_va + gv_inst_offset`.
  4. Read instruction bytes (`gv_inst_length`) and parse displacement at `gv_inst_disp`.
  5. Recover GV address: `gv_va = inst_addr + gv_inst_length + disp_i32`.
  6. Recompute `gv_rva` and write updated GV YAML.
- If old YAML already carries `gv_sig_allow_across_function_boundary`, relocated output preserves the field.
- In `preprocess_common_skill`, direct GV generation reads `_gv_gen_opts.get("gv_sig_allow_across_function_boundary", False)` and writes the field back only when the directive is explicitly enabled.

## Downstream Use
- Current dist gamedata updaters mainly consume function/offset/patch outputs.
- `gv_sig` is primarily used by analysis/preprocess relocation flow.

## Practical Notes
- Uniqueness must be instruction-level strict.
- Over-wildcarding hurts uniqueness; under-wildcarding hurts portability.
- `gv_inst_*` must stay consistent with RIP-relative disp32 model.
- `gv_sig_allow_across_function_boundary` changes generation breadth only; relocation still depends on the resolved access instruction and its displacement metadata.
