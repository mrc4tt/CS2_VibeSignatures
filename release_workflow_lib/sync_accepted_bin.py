"""Idempotently mirror a source gamebin tree into the persisted accepted bin tree.

The warm IDB cache producer prepares configured binaries and warms IDA databases
from them; PR and release consumers then restore that cache and analyze the exact
same binaries. This module makes the accepted-bin lifecycle follow the warmup
lifecycle: after a successful warmup run (whether the cache hit or was freshly
warmed), the actual binaries the run consumed are transactionally, idempotently
mirrored into ``PERSISTED_WORKSPACE/bin/<GAMEVER>`` so the accepted tree always
reflects the warmup input.

The accepted tree is binary-only: YAML, IDA databases, and BinSync state are
excluded. A dedicated per-version binary-cache lock makes direct invocations safe.

Source and accepted trees must contain exactly the configured binaries. Their
full SHA-256 inventories are compared even when paths and sizes agree, so cache
corruption cannot survive an idempotent sync.
