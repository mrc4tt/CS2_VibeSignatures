"""Idempotently mirror a source gamebin tree into the persisted accepted bin tree.

The warm IDB cache producer prepares configured binaries and warms IDA databases
from them; PR and release consumers then restore that cache and analyze the exact
same binaries. This module makes the accepted-bin lifecycle follow the warmup
lifecycle: after a successful warmup run (whether the cache hit or was freshly
warmed), the actual binaries the run consumed are transactionally, idempotently
mirrored into ``PERSISTED_WORKSPACE/bin/<GAMEVER>`` so the accepted tree always
reflects the warmup input.

The merge-time ``promote_bin`` path remains the verification gate for accepted
bin. ``sync_accepted_bin`` shares its per-version lock and the same-hash fast path,
so the two writers cannot race and a later merge-time promote becomes a no-op when
the warmup already wrote identical bytes.

When the source and accepted trees already agree by path and size - the common
cache-hit case - the comparison takes a no-hash skeleton fast path and the
returned ``hash`` is ``None`` because no content hash was computed.
